This repository demonstrates a common error in Node.js: unhandled exceptions within asynchronous callbacks.  The `bug.js` file showcases a server that might throw an error in a `setTimeout` callback.  The error is not caught, causing a silent failure. The `bugSolution.js` provides a corrected version with proper error handling using a `try...catch` block, demonstrating how to prevent this type of issue.  This example highlights the importance of comprehensive error handling, particularly when dealing with asynchronous operations in Node.js.
